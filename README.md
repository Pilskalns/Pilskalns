Hello ðŸ‘‹,

I'm a full-stack web developer and IT engineer in the broadcast industry.

My experiences spans across web technologies, video, networking, cloud, scripting, programming and many other buzzwords. Though, a common theme in my work is that I do love building tools and platforms that shape and serve content - be it text, video, websites, serverless data transformations, or anything in between and beyond.

Recently I have acquired AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional and Mikrotik engineer certifications. While my time is not focused on open-source, I do enjoy any chance I get to. Also, my favourite emoji seems to be ðŸ‘€.
